#### leadership
I've led several projects in my previous career in academic advising, had leadership roles as an instructor constructing new courses in the English department, and as a student leading group projects and research projects.  However, one of my favorite activities these days is being a dungeon master for my kids who love playing DnD.  This takes a lot of 1) preparation: in addition to creating a story that is rich and structured but not too directive, I also build battle maps out of Legos (their characters are Lego minifigures) which may or may not be used, depending on their characters' choices; 2) flexibility: my kids (6 and 8) often make totally counter-intuitive choices, which I then need to figure out how to have the world respond to in a way that will still be fun and exciting and lead to story progression; 3) encouragement: my youngest can get disheartened by rolling low, which I then need to reframe as an opportunity for more adventure (you rolled too low to sneak past the goblins?  Now we get to see if you can persuade them, fool them, or fight them!).  I love it!  The surprises that they bring to me are the most fun to work with and see how they shape the story in new, unexpected ways.  



#### difficulty with team member
At Amazon, my internship project was to conduct an analysis of Alexa customers and identify factors leading to customer dropout --- that is, to perform inference on how much more likely different customer interactions made it that the customer would stop using Alexa.  My mentor was very helpful, providing suggestions on modeling as well as insight into customer segments.  Unfortunately, my mentor was replaced mid-internship, and my newly assigned mentor was not situated well to help me.  I tried to work with my new mentor to bring him up to speed on my project, but he was already trying to get up to speed on his own responsibilities and was not well-versed in the statistical methods I was using.  Thus I asked if he would be OK if I consulted with my skip-level on the project.  My skip-level supervisor was able to provide useful suggestions, which I looped my mentor in on, and also pointed me toward people in adjacent units who could assist me.  Among other things, one of those people recalled that one department had actually worked on something similar before --- they had been trying to *predict* customer dropout.  When I looked at the existing predictive model, I found that there was a lot of room for improvement.  My actions led to the successful completion of the internship project (the inferential model), my mentor becoming more well-versed in the statistical methods I used as well as more familiar with customer segments, my unit becoming more connected in the organization, and I also constructed a predictive model that highly outperformed the previous model.
