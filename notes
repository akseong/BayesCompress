10/10 meeting


Kate Kirby:
	Daniel Gross - work together?


Farideh:
	- Duha Alfatlawi (Surgery; Anthony Chau) - selection bias, optimal carotid artery intervention in cases with CKD with stenosis
	- Anzoula ... (surgery? biomedical engineering?  experiment on mice)  Wants power analysis to submit for grant in January


Jaylen:
	Joyce Lee - prediabetes, latino/hispanic pop'ns; wants interim analysis
	Olivia Yanes, Melissa Lodoen - Toxoplasma Gondii on Alzheimer's


Thabat:
	Kate Simon - with Marissa - K08 insufficient sleep and depression; repeated measures, mixed model
	Shannon Cotton - Race-based limitations in pulse oximetry 

	**Kayla Prieto-Hodge - Rutgers criminology - sounds super interesting
	**sickle-cell disease  project



Marissa:
	Kate Simon project (Thabat observing)
	**Joey Wong - vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular neuropathologic changes in the elderly (seems like a new project)
	Dequina Nicholas - Reviewer critiques on stat analysis; Insulin induces membrane surface localization of GLUT1 to increase glycolysis in murine gonadotropes - brand new project	
	**Ana Herrera - public health - law enforcement agency type on flavored tobacco sales









types of research questions where would be beneficial
- real world examples
- basic example and more complex example (multi-level model - Peyton's example) 



Marissa - Joey Wong, Ana Herrera?
Thabat - nhanes, Oluwaseun Awosanya sickle-cell projects; shannon cotton (oximetry), Kayla Prieto-Hodges policing

Olivia Yanes - toxoplasma and Alzheimer's, spaghetti plots, mixed effect model, interp, summary.  






Meeting with Joni:
- Olivia Yanes project - 2 2-level models --- level 1 FOV, level 1 individual obs


- time log - goal is to be able to account for 50 out of 80 hours
- berd brains, staff meetings,

1 hour Minhaz - on time log, maybe just need to help him draft an email to NHANES people

email Marissa, CC Joni, re: Joey Wong project


Nov 7 Bayesian stats presentation


Monday 1 hr meetings
surgery --- surgical outcome for 4 procedures, adjusted for SES, broken into quintiles; 0.5 million obs dataset ---> 150 obs, most (all but 13) concentrated in bottom 2 SES quintiles







comparing 2 diets - PLATO diet vs animal-based proteins for patients with kidney disease
8 patients, 2 years - baseline, 9, 24 months
- serum, urine samples; urimic toxin levels

- think that diets interact with kidney disease


primary outcome - cognitive function measure (1 score); 1/2 of patients have MRIs (to count microbleeds)









Nov 5
Olivia Yanes project meeting notes: 
amy_exp <- data.frame(emmeans(amy_sp, ~condition*obs_time, at = list(obs_time = 0:6), level = .95))




Add contrasts to coefficient tables
- take b0, b1 out of FDR adjustment

b3 + b3*




without p-vals / tests (just add CIs)
b1 + b1*
b1 + b1* + b3 + b3*

visualization of data:  ?



# CIs only: wk 6-8 slopes: b1 + b1*, b1 + b1* + b3 + b3*

boi <- c(
  "$\\beta_3 + \\beta_{3\\star}$",
  "$\\beta_1 + \\beta_{1\\star}$",
  "$\\beta_1 + \\beta_{1\\star} + \\beta_3 + \\beta_{3\\star}$"
)

boi_mat <- rbind(
  c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1),
  c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),
  c(0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1)
)
colnames(boi_mat) <- coefnames
rownames(boi_mat) <- boi











11/12
- timesheet!! - 1 hours
- Olivia Yanes doc
- fix Bayes pres

at home --- try implementing a few things:
- simple FC layers
- inclusion control based on Bayesian FDR?



11/14
To do:
  - fix Bayes pres  XX  2hours



11/15
- BayesCompress
  - inclusion control based on Bayesian FDR?
  - how to stop?




- fix Bayes pres MCMC portion





Raymond Wang - pup loss

- wants to understand why and when pups are dying in pregnancy.
- from a litter of 6, should have 3 heterozygote and 3 homozygote
- instead, consistently find imbalanced ratios in the litters (e.g. 5 heterozygote, 1 homozygote), suggesting pup loss during pregnancy.  (Had several reasons why he believes that the mother should start off with roguhly 50-50 hetero- and homozygote pups.)

Issue:
- cannot get pup genetics during gestation without sacrificing mother (?)
- instead, can observe number of gestational sacs via ultrasound, and see if any are lost over time.



- wants to be able to figure out *when* pups are dying, and *why*
    - if can figure out when pups are dying in pregnancy, can then sacrifice mother (and pups / gestational sacs) and try to figure out the why
    - why does he need statistics for this?

Not exactly sure what he wants from us.  
- power calculation for.... ?   what is the hypothesis he wants to test?
- seems interested in early stopping, i.e. not sacrificing as many mothers? but I thought the whole thing was that they were not going to sacrifice the pregnant mothers?
